# Implementation Guide: Generate Content Feature

This document outlines the steps to implement the "Generate Content" feature in the Anylingo application.

## 1. Frontend: "Generate Content" Page

- [ ] Create a new HTML file `views/generate.html` for the "Generate Content" page.
- [ ] The page will contain an input field for the user to paste a URL and a "Generate" button.
- [ ] Create a new JavaScript file `js/generate.js` to handle the logic for this page.
- [ ] Add a new route in `js/app.js` for the `/generate` page.
- [ ] The "Generate" button will send the URL to a new backend endpoint.

## 2. Backend: Content Generation Endpoint

- [ ] Create a new backend endpoint `/api/generate` in `backend/server.js`.
- [ ] This endpoint will accept a URL as a parameter.
- [ ] The backend will use a library to download the content from the URL.
- [ ] The backend will use a speech-to-text service to transcribe audio content.
- [ ] The backend will then use a large language model (LLM) to:
    -   Translate the text.
    -   Extract key vocabulary to create flashcards.
    -   Generate example sentences.
    -   Create practice dialogues.
- [ ] The newly generated content will be saved to the respective data files (e.g., `flashcards.json`, `sentences.json`, `dialogues.json`).

## 3. Deployment and Branching Strategy

- [ ] All development for this feature will be done in the `feature/content-generation` branch.
- [ ] Once the feature is complete and tested, the branch will be merged into the `main` branch.
